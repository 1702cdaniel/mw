                <h3>Solving Problems and Being Lazy</h3>
                <p>
                Should I write a blog post for this? Or find a blog post written 
                on this exact topic.This time I’ll choose to ignore that advice.

                The talk was genuinely very interesting. The gist is: be efficient! 
                Take a complex problem, break that complex problem into a series of 
                small, simple problems, and find the ‘laziest’ way to solve that 
                problem. What I took from that is – don’t go overboard! This is a 
                problem I always find myself having, I become far too preoccupied with 
                solving every possible forgone conclusion that the complex problem may 
                present that I find myself making a metaphorical mountain out of a 
                metaphorical molehill.

                The example given to us today was the Fibonacci sequence. Maths is 
                always a good way to relate to a class of Computer Science students 
                so I applaud Billy’s intrigue. Instantly I thought, “Easy, define f(1) 
                = 1 and f(2) = 1 and let f(n) = f(n-1) + f(n-2)”. Done! But I had 
                neglected many of the smaller problems! What is someone tried f(a), 
                or f(-20)? THAT’S IMPOSSIBLE! But as a programmer you must never 
                underestimate the stupidity of man. And that’s the sort of problem that 
                many programmers would seem to miss. Another problem that was pointed 
                out was f(n>100). Does every computer have the processing power to 
                calculate such large functions? The simple answer to this is to “be
                lazy” and stop the user from inputting values larger than n=100. That’s
                something I’ll have to consider in the future and more imminently 
                for this blog!

                Billy is certainly a good speaker, I never felt someone could sell 
                the premise of being lazy to a group of “gifted” students so well.
