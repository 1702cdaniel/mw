                I should have realised that going to bed at 1:30am was a bad idea; 
                getting up at 4:30am never feels good, and only 3 hours sleep never 
                helps that. Airport food was airport food, and I despaired as I found
                my scrambled egg in a puddle of “egg juice” this morning. This was 
                followed by a plane journey inbetween two bulky men. Fantastic!

                 Villiers has finally come, or rather I have come to Villiers. On 
                 arrival I was shocked to find a room full of completely socially 
                 capable people. We started by being told that pubs are a no go, and 
                 I’m Irish.

                Being in the same room as someone who knows 7 coding languages is 
                always little daunting… but I find myself fitting in. This week 
                should hopefully confirm to me that Computer Science is the right 
                course for me. I look forward to learning languages that aren’t 
                French. My group is the Java group, and I hope for the love of God 
                that they know more about coding than I do.

                Our task: to create the most beautiful blog known to man. On failing 
                that, make a decent blog. If I’m honest, I chose Java because it 
                seemed the most familiar, and if I’m honest that’s the most familiar 
                due to my many years of Minecraft, which were serious business.

                I am pleased with the task we have been given. For a complete noob 
                like myself it would be nice to log my coding progress from the start 
                to be able to review my progress and look back in years to come to laugh 
                at my many failures. And as Billy said, future employers will enjoy 
                reading it, and probably enjoy laughing at me too.
