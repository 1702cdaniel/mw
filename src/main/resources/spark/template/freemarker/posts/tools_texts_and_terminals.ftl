                The text editor that I use when I get the time to code is Sublime. 
                I much prefer Sublime’s sleek design to that of Notepad++ and I 
                especially enjoy the ease of navigation provided by the automatic
                colour-coding on the programme. However, I can’t say I’ve used enough 
                text editors to decide that Sublime is the be all and end all.

                During the talk today, Billy recommended Eclipse for use in coding Java. I’ll have to give this a go as if there’s any week to try something new it’s this week!
